I'm interested in learninng more about computer science since being a software engineer would allow me to pursue my interest in traveling. In my free time, I like to experiment in the visual arts. My personal favorite mediums are watercolor and graphite but it's always fun to experiment. I also have been getting into reading lately in an attempt to lower my screen time but most of my time is currently taken up by schoolwork.
