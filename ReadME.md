I'm interested in learning more about computer science since being a software engineer would allow me to pursue my interest in traveling. In my free time, I like to experiment in visual arts, with my personal favorite mediums being watercolor and graphite. I've also have been getting into reading lately in an attempt to lower my screen time but most of my time is currently taken up by schoolwork.
